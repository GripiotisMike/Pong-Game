# Pong Game

A classic Pong game created using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The game features two paddles, a bouncing ball, and a scoring system.

1. Install Python (if not already installed).

2. Run the game by executing Pong Game.py
 
3. Control the paddles:
- Player 1: Use the O (up) and L (down) keys.
- Player 2: Use the Q (up) and A (down) keys.

4. Scoring:
- Each time the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player scores a point.
- The first player to reach 10 points wins the game.

# How It Works

- The game uses the turtle library to draw the paddles, ball, and net.
- The ball bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom walls.
- The score is displayed at the top of the screen, and the game ends when a player reaches 10 points.
